# Amazon-Kindle-Books-Data-Analysis

Amazon Kindle books are digital eBooks available on Amazon's Kindle platform. These books can be purchased or borrowed and read using Kindle devices, the Kindle app (on smartphones, tablets, or computers), or directly through web browsers.  

Hence, they have significant amounts of data based on books, ratings, authors, and vendors (traditional publishers, independent authors or other lenders). This project thoroughly analyzes this data to understand different factors and learn insights that will improve Amazon Kindle’s commercial success.

The focus will be on the following key areas:

**Categorical impact on the sales.** An investigation on how different genres, such as History, Comics, or Business & Money, influence sales performance.

**Book Review trends analysis.** An illustration of the trends in book reviews over time.

**Vendor performance.** An analysis of the number of books sold by each vendor.

**Categorical impact on the sales.**

•	It reveals that **‘Mystery, Thriller, and Suspense’** books are very popular on Kindle having **6250** books sold till October 2023. Moreover, Comic books are least bought by the Kindle customers indicating that people like to prefer comics in hardcopies. 

•	Speaking about the availability of books on Kindle Unlimited subscription platform, **Romance genre** has **74.83%** of books in Kindle Unlimited indicating that it is more prevalent within the service. And it is followed by **LGBTQ+(71.10%)** and **Science fiction (59.78)** books. 

•	On the other hand, **Political & Social Sciences (6.53%)**, and **Science & Math (6.51%)** show lower availability, suggesting an opportunity to expand Kindle Unlimited's offerings in these areas.

**Book Review trends analysis.**

•	This line chart demonstrates a clear upward trend in the number of reviews, particularly after 2011.

•	This increase is likely attributed to the rise of e-books and Kindle, with significant acceleration **post-2015**. Notably, books published in the last few years (2021-2023), achieving the highest review count of **5717924 in the year 2020**, are garnering more reviews, which suggests higher engagement from readers. 

•	The growth in reviews indicates rising customer interest and could be leveraged to promote bestsellers or encourage further customer interaction.

## Recommendations

•	Genres such as **Law, Parenting & relationships**, and **Business & Money** are currently underrepresented in the subscription service, which exhibits an opportunity to enhance diversity and attract more subscribers. Also, focusing on target audience with famous genres can help in increasing Kindle users.

•	The **Vendor Management team** can explore partnerships with top-selling vendors to enhance the catalog and improve variety.

•	With the growing number of reviews, particularly for recent publications, the **Marketing Team** can strategically use campaigns to improve number of customers and subscribers.
